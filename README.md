# RoboND-Build-My-World

The goal of the project was to build a simulated world in gazebo. Following were the main objectives of the project:

1. Create a building structure using the Building Editor tool. Familiarize with the different features, add colors and modify the default parameters.
2. Using the Model Editor tool, create a robot model. By using the preexisting shapes and using joints to attach the parts to form a single-body robot.
3. Build a complete world. Include the building and multiple instances of the robot model created before. Moreover, add additional objects from the Gazebo library. 

This world will be used in used in future projects to implement more advanced algorithms.
